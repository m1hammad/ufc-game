# **FACE OF THE FIGHT GAME**

The FACE OF THE FIGHT GAME app, FIGHT GAME, for short, allows the logged in user to sign a fighter with the use of a form or contract. A fighter's biography can be completely uploaded, including photo, current record, age and so on.

A logged in user can also equip a fighter with skills and training equipment to make them a more viable contender for the undisputed world championship. After providing their character with a suitable training camp, their fighter can be pinned against another user's fighter in a completely sanctioned main event of a major fight card. If their opponent is the current champion of their weight class and the opponent is defeated, then their fighter becomes the undisputed champion.

The event winners are simulated based on their training. Have they received adequate training equipment and skills necessary for the big win? It is up to you to make sure your fighter is ready for competition! If your fighter has a more adequate training camp than your opponent, they will have 75/25 odds of winning the match. It is better to still allow for an opportunity for the opponent to win because in fighting, any fighter has a "puncher's chance" to win.

## Future Work

- **A more sophisticated event simulator** I would like to complicate how the simulation determines a winner.
- **Updating fighter records** I would like a win or loss to impact the fighter's record overall.
- **Add draw feature** I would like to add a draw feature to the game as part of the simulation.
- **Add more matches** I would like to add more matches to the event feature.
